Python Code Challenges: Strings

Python Code Challenges involving Strings

This article will help you review Python functions by providing some code challenges about strings.

Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about them before starting to code.

You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your output, try to find where you’re going wrong, and iterate on your solution.

Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer” twice with an incorrect solution, you should see an option to get our solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and play with the solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is working. Good luck!
Function Syntax

As a refresher, function syntax looks like this:
"""
def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):
  # … do something with the inputs …
  return output
"""
For example, a function that finds the difference in length between two Strings would look like this:
"""
def lengthDiff(str1, str2):
  return len(str1) - len(str2)
"""
And this would produce output like:
"""
lengthDiff("Python", "rocks")
"""
1
"""
lengthDiff("Marco", "Polo")
"""
1
"""
lengthDiff("Kevin", "Durant")
"""
-1
